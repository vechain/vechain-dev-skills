# VeChain Kit Skill

## CRITICAL RULES

1. **Read reference files FIRST.** When the user's request involves any topic in the reference table below, read those files before doing anything else — before writing code, before making decisions. Briefly mention which files you are reading so the user can confirm the skill is active (e.g., "Reading VeChain Kit reference...").
2. **Information priority for VeChain topics:** (a) Reference files in this skill — always the primary source. (b) VeChain MCP tools — use `@vechain/mcp-server` for on-chain data, transaction building, and live network queries; use Kapa AI MCP for VeChain documentation lookups. (c) Web search — only as a last resort, and only for topics NOT covered in the reference files.
3. **Prefer working directly in the main conversation** for VeChain tasks. Plan mode and subagents do not inherit skill context and may fall back to web search instead of using reference files.
4. **After compaction or context loss**, re-read this SKILL.md to restore awareness of the reference table and operating procedure before continuing work.

## Scope

Use this Skill for frontend dApp development on VeChain:

- VeChain Kit: full-featured React/Next.js dApp library
- dapp-kit: lightweight wallet connection for non-React or minimal setups
- Wallet connection, social login (email, Google, passkey), smart accounts
- Pre-built UI components (WalletButton, TransactionModal)
- Hooks (useWallet, useSendTransaction, useCallClause, token/domain/oracle hooks)
- React Query caching, query keys, cache invalidation
- Transaction UX, loading states, confirmation patterns
- Theming and Privy setup
- i18n with react-i18next: bi-directional language sync (Kit ↔ host app), pre-commit/ESLint for missing or unused translation keys

## Default stack


| Layer    | Default                         | Alternative                                       |
| -------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Frontend | `@vechain/vechain-kit`          | `@vechain/dapp-kit-react` (lightweight/non-React) |
| Node     | Node 20 LTS (managed via `nvm`) | --                                                |


## Operating procedure

### 1. Check Node version

Before installing dependencies or running any command:

- Check if `.nvmrc` exists in the project root. If yes, run `nvm use`.
- If `.nvmrc` does not exist, create one with `20` (Node 20 LTS) and run `nvm use`.

### 2. Detect project structure

- `turbo.json` present → follow Turborepo conventions (`apps/frontend`, `packages/`*)
- Use `useThor` for Thor client access (both VeChain Kit and dapp-kit v2). `useConnex` is deprecated everywhere.
- Apply conditional patterns (Chakra UI, i18n, Zustand) only when the project uses them

### 3. Choose the right library

**When to ask the user:** If the project doesn't already use VeChain Kit or dapp-kit and the user hasn't specified which to use, ask before choosing. Key questions:

- Do you need social login (email, Google, passkey)? → VeChain Kit
- Do you want pre-built UI modals and hooks (WalletButton, TransactionModal, token hooks)? → VeChain Kit
- Do you want a lightweight wallet-only integration with minimal dependencies? → dapp-kit
- Non-React framework? → dapp-kit

### 4. Clarify before implementing

When the user's request is ambiguous or could be solved multiple ways, **ask before building**. Separate research from implementation.

### 5. Implement with VeChain-specific correctness

- Network: always explicit (`mainnet`/`testnet`/`solo`)
- Social login: Generic Delegator auto-enabled (users pay gas in VET/VTHO/B3TR); app-sponsored delegation optional for better UX; smart accounts; pre-fetch data before `sendTransaction`

### 6. Verify and deliver

A task is **not complete** until all applicable gates pass:

1. **Code compiles** — no build errors (`npm run build` or equivalent succeeds)
2. **Tests pass** — existing tests still pass; new logic has test coverage
3. **Risk notes documented** — any signing, fee, or token-transfer implications are called out

## Reference files

Read the matching files BEFORE doing anything else. See Critical Rules above.
