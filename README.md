## Skills

### vechain-dev

Core VeChain development — SDK usage, fee delegation (VIP-191), multi-clause transactions, dual-token model, and legacy migration from Connex/thor-devkit.

### vechain-kit

Frontend dApp development with VeChain Kit and dapp-kit — wallet connection, social login, smart accounts, hooks, components, React Query patterns, and transaction UX.

### smart-contract-development

Solidity smart contract development on VeChainThor — Hardhat setup, ERC-20/721 patterns, upgradeable contracts, gas optimization, testing with Thor Solo, security auditing, and ABI codegen.

### vebetterdao

VeBetterDAO and X2Earn app development — B3TR/VOT3 tokens, reward distribution, sustainability proofs, app submission, governance, VeVote, and quadratic funding.

### stargate

StarGate staking on VeChainThor — NFT-based staking, tiered rewards, validator delegation, node management, boosting, and Phase 2 changes.

### translate

Manages react-i18next translation files across 15 languages. Adds/removes keys, keeps files sorted, enforces fixed-word rules, and verifies sync with the source locale.

### grill-me

Interview you relentlessly about every aspect of a plan until shared understanding is reached. Walks down each branch of the design tree, resolving dependencies between decisions one-by-one.

### auto-voting-relayers

Complete domain knowledge for VeBetterDAO's auto-voting and relayer system -- smart contracts (XAllocationVoting, VoterRewards, RelayerRewardsPool), relayer node, relayer dashboard, fee mechanics, and veDelegate comparison.

### create-vechain-dapp

Scaffold a VeChain dApp with Next.js 14, VeChain Kit, Chakra UI v3, and GitHub Pages deployment. Supports standalone (frontend-only) or monorepo (Turbo + Hardhat contracts) modes.

### vechain-react-native-dev

React Native VeWorld wallet integration — deep link communication, NaCl encryption, transaction signing, certificate signing, EIP-712 typed data, and multi-network support via `@vechain/react-native-wallet-link`.
